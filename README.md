# copland-plymouth-theme


  Two plymouth themes inspired from SEL(Copland OS). <sub>I used same progress bar for both themes  .    .    .      because I am lazy  </sub>
#
  ## usage  
  [note : this is not the ideal way but it works]  
  - copy navi + copland directory to /usr/share/plymouth/themes/
  - open terminal and run one of these command `sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R navi` or   `sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R copland`
  - check your current theme with `plymouth-set-default-theme`
